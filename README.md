# Cleptor

Cleptor is a phishing toolkit designed to host and serve phishing templates for popular social media platforms. It uses a local PHP server to serve the phishing pages and exposes them to the internet via ngrok tunnels. The tool includes a Flask-based web dashboard for managing phishing sites, monitoring captured credentials and IP logs, and controlling the phishing services.

## Features

- Multiple phishing templates for social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat.
- Local PHP server to serve phishing pages.
- Ngrok integration to expose the local server publicly.
- Secure Flask web dashboard with login authentication.
- Real-time display of captured credentials and IP addresses.
- Ability to clear logs directly from the dashboard.
- Status indicators for PHP server and ngrok tunnel.
- Easy management of phishing templates and logs.

## Prerequisites

Before using Cleptor, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.x**  
- **Flask** (install via `pip install flask`)  
- **PHP** (for serving phishing templates)  
- **Ngrok** (included in the project folder as a binary)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd cleptor
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install flask requests
   ```

3. Ensure the `ngrok` binary is executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x ngrok
   ```

4. If you do not have ngrok, download it from [https://ngrok.com/download](https://ngrok.com/download) and place the executable in the project root directory.

## How It Works

- The Flask app (`launcher.py`) provides a web dashboard protected by login credentials (`cleptor` / `cleptor`).
- Upon login, it starts a local PHP server to serve phishing templates located in the `websites/` directory.
- Ngrok is launched to create a public tunnel to the local PHP server, generating a public URL for phishing.
- The dashboard displays the list of available phishing sites, the public phishing URL, and real-time logs of captured credentials and IP addresses.
- Users can clear logs for each phishing site from the dashboard.
- Logging and service status are continuously monitored and displayed.

## Usage

1. Start the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python3 launcher.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:

   ```
   http://localhost:5000/login
   ```

3. Login with the following credentials:

   - Username: `cleptor`
   - Password: `cleptor`

4. After login, the dashboard will display:

   - A list of phishing sites to select from.
   - The public phishing URL generated by ngrok.
   - Captured credentials and IP logs updating every 5 seconds.
   - Buttons to clear logs for each site.
   - Status indicators for PHP server and ngrok tunnel.

5. Use the dashboard to monitor and manage phishing campaigns.

6. Click "Logout" to stop services and exit the dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

- **Ngrok tunnel not starting:**  
  Ensure `ngrok` binary is executable and not blocked by firewall or antivirus.
  Sometimes reloading the page or logging out and logging back in can resolve the issue.

- **PHP server not running:**  
  Verify PHP is installed and accessible from the command line.

- **Dashboard not loading or login issues:**  
  Check Flask server logs for errors and ensure dependencies are installed.

- **Captured logs not updating:**  
  Confirm phishing templates are correctly logging credentials and IPs to the `logs/` directory.
